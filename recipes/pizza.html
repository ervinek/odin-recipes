<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Margherita, the quintessential Italian dish that captures the heart of Naples. With its thin, crisp crust, vibrant tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella, and fragrant fresh basil, this pizza is a masterpiece of balance and flavor.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<p><strong>For the base</strong></p>
<li>300g strong bread flour</li>
<li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

<p><strong>For the tomato sauce</strong></p>
<li>100ml passata</li>
<li>handful fresh basil</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>

<p><strong>For the topping</strong></p>
<li>125g ball mozzarella</li>
<li>handful grated parmesan</li>
<li>handful of cherry tomatoes</li>

<p><strong>To finish</strong></p>
<li>handful of basil leaves</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but its not essential for a thin crust.</li>
<li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
<li>Roll out the dough: if youve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
<li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
